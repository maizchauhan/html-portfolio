<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Maiz Chauhan. I'm a web developer living in Gujarat, India. i create a responsive website for client. 
  currently I'm working at Arvalli samachar News Channel as intern. I enjoy bulding everything from small business sites 
  to rich intractive websites.     
  I'm passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I'm never satisfied 
  to just come up with ideas. insted i have an almost impulsiv need to act on them.</p>

<p>I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught,
  personality is inherent. i prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting thngs that metters.</p>

<p>I'm a fast learner, able to pickup new skills and juggle different projects and rles withe reletive ease.</p>
